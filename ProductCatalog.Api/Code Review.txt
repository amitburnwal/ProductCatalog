Common Observation
1) Use of Try Catch is not there
2) Unused namespaces are referenced.
3) Test cases are not covered for negative and edge case scenarios

5) Urls and application constants are declared inline. instead they should be declared in appsettings.json file.
6) No Logging and exception code written. We can think of some Exception Filter in middleware to catch exceptions. 
7)
